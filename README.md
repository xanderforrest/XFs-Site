<h1>Flask/Bootstrap powered website with blog features</h1>

<h2><a href="www.xanderforrest.com">Take a look. (Note, currently live site is still static version)</a></h2>

<br>

This was originally a static site used to advertise my business created with
Bootstrap Studio and hosted with a simple AWS Bucket. Converting to a responsive
site with Flask in order to give myself more options such as blog posts, and
control of more of my programs/services that run from home. And learning.

The basic blog features were taken from an earlier project I wrote, but
I switched to using SQLAlchemy instead of the default SQLite3 package,
along with some other improvements.

<h3> Requirements to run </h3>
